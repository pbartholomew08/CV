  \opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

  I am writing in regards to the Aero-Acoustics Simulation Engineer position advertised through the
  UK Fluids Network.

  As my CV shows, I have 6 years' experience as a researcher in the field of CFD: first as a PhD
  student when I developed a two-fluid solver for simulating particle-laden flows; and in my current
  position as a Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) in the department of Aeronautics, Imperial
  College London.
  I also pursued a CFD-focused project in my Masters year, having been inspired by the Undergraduate
  Research Opportunities Programme position for which I was awarded funding to complete.
  I have published two papers from my research during my PhD and PDRA positions and have presented
  my work at both national and international conferences.

  In my current position as a PDRA I have worked on two projects: implementing a variable-density
  solver for Low Mach Number (LMN) flows for the in-house code \texttt{Incompact3D}; and following
  this extending its capabilities to simulate free-surface flows.
  Although not the focus of these projects, the starting point for development was a research paper
  using an LMN solver to study jet noise using the Lighthill analogy, thus I have some awareness of
  modelling aero-acoustics.
  
  I am confident that my broad experience as a researcher in the field of CFD, working
  with/developing several research codes, makes me an excellent candidate for this position.
  I enclose my Curriculum Vitae and look forward to hearing from you.

  \closing{Yours faithfully,}
