%\vspace{5mm}

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Associate (PDRA) at Imperial College London with six years' experience
working with, and developing, Computational Fluid Dynamics software for research.
In the course of this research I have developed extensive skills working with research software and
programming in widely used scientific languages including \texttt{C}, \texttt{Fortran} and
\texttt{Python} and a passion for developing scientific software.
