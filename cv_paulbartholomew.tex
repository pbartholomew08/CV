%\vspace{5mm}

I am a research assistant at Imperial College London, currently working on the eCSE project `A
high-order accurate solver for free-surface flows' and previously completed a PhD at Imperial
College London, working on the development of a fully-coupled solver for the two-fluid model of
multiphase flows.
In the course of my research, I have implemented a variable-density solver for Incompact3D as part
of a previous eCSE project, and am continuing this work to develop free-surface capabilities for the
Incompact3D software; during my PhD I developed pressure-velocity implicit and
pressure-velocity-volume fraction implicit solvers for the two-fluid model on collocated,
unstructured meshes in MultiFlow.
Additionally, my research interests have covered Momentum Weighted Interpolation and its application
to multiphase flows, particularly the theoretical basis for, and justification of, its use.
I have a broad experience of working with parallel, general purpose CFD codes developed in-house and
have contributed to their development in a range of areas including: IO, automated meshing and
investigating preconditioners in addition to the implementation of the aforementioned solvers.
% In addition to my research work I am also responsible for the installation and maintenance of the
% van Wachem research group's computers.

  During this project we have as a group undertaken a significant rewrite of the Incompact3D
  software to produce Xcompact3D with the intention of modernising the code base and making it
  easier to use for non group members.

%Please find enclosed my CV in application for the position of Research Assistant in An adjoint solver for variable-density flows in the low Mach number limit at the Department of Aeronautics.\\
%
%I am currently finishing a PhD in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) under the
%supervision of Prof. van Wachem and Dr. Marquis at the Department of Mechanical
%Engineering, Imperial College London.
%Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated from the MEng. programme in mechanical engineering at Imperial College London.
%During my undergraduate studies, I undertook courses in Computational Fluid
%Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis in addition to the further maths and fluid
%dynamics courses amongst others.
%In my final year project, I impelemented a code to solve the two-fluid model,
%supervised by Dr. Marquis, sparking an interest which directed me to pursue the
%PhD project I am currently undertaking.\\
%
%My PhD project focuses on the development of an implicit framework for the
%two-fluid model with the aim of enhanced stability for simulating complex
%gas-solid flows.
%I have implemented this in the in-house CFD code \texttt{MultiFlow}, a `coupled
%balanced-force numerical framework for single- and multi-phase flows at all
%speed on unstructured meshes', written in C and interfacing with the PETSc
%library.
%This has given me a broad experience of working with a complex, parallel code
%base and I have had the opportunity to work on a range of features in the code,
%becoming a major contributor to the code.
%
%
%
%The PhD project I have since been part of focuses on the development of
%numerical methods for interfacial two-phase flows, with the objective
%of making the accurate modelling of multi-scale interfacial flows in
%complex geometries feasible.
%	To that end, I have contributed to the development of the in-house CFD code \texttt{MultiFlow}, a `coupled balanced-force numerical framework for single- and multi-phase flows at all speeds on unstructured meshes' written in C and using the MPI library for its parallelisation. Having been involved in the making of \texttt{MultiFlow} since its early-days, I have been one its main contributors with 66,000 lines of code written, out of the 285,000 lines the code is made of (to this date). This 4-year long immersion into the development of a parallel CFD code gave me an unvaluable opportunity to touch upon the various specificities of such programmes. Alongside my involvement on the general features of \texttt{MultiFlow}, my research has focused on the developement of numerical methods for interfacial two-phase flows, and has so-far lead to one publication in a peer-reviewed journal -- with three additional papers being currently under review -- as well as eight presentations at international conferences. My involvement in the department also includes teaching assistant roles in the 2nd year mathematics and 4th year CFD courses, and the co-supervision of an MSc thesis.\\
%
%I believe that my experience with computational fluid dynamics and my awareness on environmental fluid dynamics and turbulence have prepared me for the position you are offering. I am a hard working and passionate researcher, eager to learn but also to share my knowledge. I am fully aware of the commitment that a position at your renowned institution requires, and I want to assure you that I am ready to throw myself entirely into it.\\
