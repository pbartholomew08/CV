* 2019-08-01 CV/Cover letter consultation

** CV

- For industry, less emphasis on publications, /e.g./ a researchgate link would suffice
- 1/2 pages is correct length for industry CV
- Check the Imperial guide to CVs
- Personal profile probably a bit long - make more punchy, use bullet points
- No need to list references: ``References available on request''

** Cover letter

- Use more margin!
- /Need a section about why you want to work there/
- Check the Imperial guide to cover letters
- Focus the mid-sections on the required skills
  - With each application go through the required skills and add to a ``database'' with
    answer/evidence, makes future applications easier!
  - Make sure to match/answer each required skill
